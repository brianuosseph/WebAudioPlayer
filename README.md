#Web Audio Player
An audio player utilizing the Web Audio API.

###To Do:
- Change frequency spectrum animation to fit canvas better
- Look into possible animation to display filter usage
- Look into possible vectorscope animation
- Improve UI after fixing functionality details


###Notes:
- Many of the first found tutorials aren't clear or up to date. Maybe make one of my own based on this project?
- Muting an audio media element is actually pausing it. But to be fair,  no one really needs to "mute" their audio for an audio player
- Restarting or reloading the audio sources isn't immediately apparent. Should continue playing with it.
